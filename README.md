# Puma-Admin-Panel-
Tried to create Puma Admin Panel. I gave more focus on the functionality part rather than UI. All the data from the user is getting added to local storage
as database and showed the details on to the product detail page.
There is a remove button to remove product data from the database as well as DOM. Netlify link : https://beautiful-granita-f18b4b.netlify.app
